**Heart Disease Prediction ML Project**

**📌 Overview**

This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease using the UCI Heart Disease Dataset.
We apply a full machine learning pipeline: preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, feature selection, supervised & unsupervised models, hyperparameter tuning, and model deployment with Github.

**⚙️ Installation**

**Clone this repo:**
git clone https://github.com/<YourUsername>/Heart-Disease-ML-Project.git

source venv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux

venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows

pip install -r requirements.txt

**📊 Dataset**

Source: UCI Heart Disease Dataset

Features: 13 predictors (age, sex, chest pain type, cholesterol, etc.)

Target: num → binary (0 = healthy, 1 = heart disease)

**🧪 Methodology**

1️⃣ Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values (median for numeric, mode for categorical).
Encoded categorical features (One-Hot Encoding).
Scaled numeric features (StandardScaler).


2️⃣ Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)

Applied PCA to reduce dimensionality.
Chose components covering 95% variance.
Visualized variance explained & scatter plots.


3️⃣ Feature Selection

Feature Importance (RandomForest, XGBoost).
Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE).
Chi-Square Test.
Selected optimal subset of predictors.


4️⃣ Supervised Learning

Trained models:
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC, ROC curves.


5️⃣ Unsupervised Learning

KMeans Clustering (Elbow method to choose K).
Hierarchical Clustering (Dendrogram analysis).
Compared clusters with true disease labels (ARI score).


6️⃣ Hyperparameter Tuning

GridSearchCV & RandomizedSearchCV.
Optimized Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM.
Selected best performing model.


7️⃣ Model Export & Deployment
Saved final pipeline as .pkl with preprocessing + model.
Deployed via Streamlit web app.
Ngrok used for external access.
